# Chaos-Explorer

## The Chaos Explorer: A Google Colab Notebook
Learn about fundamental concepts in chaos theory with interactive and engaging Python-based visualizations! This project presents a basic computational study of chaos theory, emphasizing nonlinear systems, fractals, and sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Using Google Colab, this notebook leverages dynamic simulations to visualize concepts such as bifurcation diagrams, strange attractors, and more. The notebook is meant to be accessible for science enthusiasts and new scholars alike, as all foundational material is discussed in detail throughout each section and no advanced math background is required or assumed.
